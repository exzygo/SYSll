**SYSll** is a robust Ruby gem offering a unified interface for executing low-level system commands across different operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Windows and Unix-based systems. It intelligently adapts commands based on the userâ€™s OS, providing seamless cross-platform compatibility.

<br>

# FEATURES

  - **Cross-platform Command Abstraction:** Dynamically handles OS-specific commands for consistent behavior.

  - **Adaptive OS Detection:** Automatically detects the operating system and selects appropriate syscalls.

  - **Extensible API Surface:** Exposes a concise yet powerful API for system interactions.

  - **Graceful Error Handling:** Implements fail-safes for invalid commands or restricted permissions.
